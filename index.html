        I'll be happy to help you.As for my personal background, I grew up in India,
        went to university at Nagarjuna University. started my career with American Express.
        Besides LinkedIn, I am on Facebook. I learned south indian carnatic music. My hobbies include
        singing, cooking, gardening, travelling, reading books. I recently redesigned my own portfolio website. It was a challenging but enjoyable experience
        that I really learned a lot from. My goal was to create a unique online presence that represents
        my personality and displays my design work in detail, while of course serving as a promotional medium
        to gain more exposure and business.</p>
